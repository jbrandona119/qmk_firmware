Just another QMK Fork

Since there are people that dislike coding or don't/can't learn, I figured sharing my lil' bits of working code (that I probably mostly borrowed from other people and tweaked a bit for me) for different keyboards that anyone can copy/paste/"steal" from. I couldn't find too many people sharing their own stuff but idk.

##Boards I've got in hurr
*Walletburner's Cajal
*Trashman's Ketch, V4N4G0N (in TheVanKeyboards folder)
*PrimeKB's Prime_E

Cajal has a working rotary encoder. All boards mentioned have working home row mods.

Read my comments. I think they're funny sometimes.
